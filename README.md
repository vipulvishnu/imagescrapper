# Image Scrapping

## Introduction

Scrapping is the process of extracting information from web pages. If you need to gather a series of data from a web page, we really need some service which reduces our development time. Here we introduce a Bot which scrapes all images from the given website url.


## Setup the environment

1. Clone the project from the github repo

2. Install requirements.txt file

3. Create your spider

4. Inherit BaseSpider into your spider

5. Give the name and start_urls from which you want to access the images
